## Behind this game

Flappy Bird was a mobile game developed by the Vietnamese game developer [Dong Nguyen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nguy%E1%BB%85n_H%C3%A0_%C4%90%C3%B4ng). The game was widely regarded as ugly and its gameplay extremely frustrating. Nevertheless, the game was a huge success, toping download lists and generating thousands of dollars in ad revenues per day

On February 10th, the author retired the game from the market, alleging that he *could not take it anymore*. Whilst it is not clear the meaning of those words, Mr. Nguyen was receiving a lot of negative comments and personal accusations because of his game.

Soon after that, the indie game site [Itch.io](http://itch.io/) organized the [Flappy Jam](http://itch.io/jam/flappyjam), a jam to develop similar games, retro and insanely difficult, to celebrate the game and the indie community.

## The game

Trying to be original, we didn't want to create a simple clone of Flappy Bird. Instead, we thought that rethinking the game to a FPS perspective would be a nice twist!",
